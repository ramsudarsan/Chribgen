Chribgen

A web extension made with React to gather non-torrent download links for books and journals from Libgen and display them in an easy to understand and use interface in the Chrome browser. Also supports adding a search term to the extension by highlighting and using the button for Chribgen on the context menu on any page. I worked on this project to better understand the ins and outs of Chrome extensions and the various Chrome APIs.

I am not responsible for anything illegal or immoral that a user chooses to use this chrome extension for. I do not condone piracy in any way, and this is meant to be used for copyright-free sources.
